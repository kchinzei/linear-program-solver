JS/TS wrapper for [simplex](https://github.com/jeronimonunes/simplex) linear programming solver by jeronimonunes

## Requirements

- Linux or macOS (Windows also by manual installation, see [Trouble shooting](#trouble-shooting))
- C++ compiler with C++-17 or newer support.
- Node 10 or newer except 11. (To be exact, N-API version 6 or newer)
- [linear-program-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/linear-program-parser) 1.0.11 or newer (npm module).
- [jeronimonunes/simplex](https://github.com/jeronimonunes/simplex) (C++ code).
- [jeronimonunes/bigint](https://github.com/jeronimonunes/bigint) (C++ code).

This module will be built even these conditions do not meet. When so, **simplex() always returns 'inviavel' (infeasible) without actually solving the problem.** To check if simplex() works, use simplexIsOK().

## Description

Linear-program-solver is a JavaScript / TypeScript wrapper to [simplex C++ engine by jeronimonunes](https://github.com/jeronimonunes/simplex).
It's intended to be used together with [linear-program-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/linear-program-parser) written in TypeScript.
There are several linear program solvers found in npm.
[Linear-program-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/linear-program-parser) is relatively new, written in TypeScript and personally easy to use among them.
Linear-program-solver can accept the output of [linear-program-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/linear-program-parser) directly.

## Code snippets

```TypeScript
import { parse, Fpi } from 'linear-program-parser';
import { simplex, findSolution, simplexIsOK  } from 'linear-program-solver';
import { SimplexTableau, SimplexSolution } from 'linear-program-solver';

const linearProgram = parse('max(-3a -4b +5c -5d)
    st:
        +1a +1b +0c +0d <= +5;
        -1a +0b -5c +5d <= -10;
        +2a +1b +1c -1d <= +10;
        -2a -1b -1c +1d <= -10;
        a >= 0;
        b >= 0;
        c >= 0;
        d >= 0;
');

const fpi = linearProgram.toFPI();
const val: SimplexSolution = simplex(fpi.toMatrix());
const a: number = findSolution('a', val.solution, val.vars);
...
```

##### type SimplexTableau\<T\>

Generic type for argument of simplex(). Currently `T` is `Fraction` for Simplex().

##### type SimplexSolution

Type of return object of simplex().

```TypeScript
extern type SimplexSolution {
  result: ( 'otima' | 'ilimitada' | 'inviavel' );
  solution: number[];
  vars: string[];
}
```

##### function simplex(arg: SimplexTableau<Fraction>): SimplexSolution

Solves standard form matrix and vectors provided by Fpi.
Input arguments are those of the output of Fpi.toMatrix().

_Result_ is either of 'otima', 'ilimitada', 'inviavel' (in Portuguese), which mean

- _great, a feasible solution found in limited iterations_,
- _okey, a solution found but iteration didn't converge_,
- _sorry, it's infeasible to solve_.

When build condition did not meet, it always returns 'inviavel' without solving simplex.

_Solution_ and _vars_ are in pair. _Vars_ is an array of given variables to solve with slack variables automatically introduced by the parser (_f_1_ ... ).
If a given variable is not constrained nonnegative, it is replaced by two nonnegative variables.
If your variable is _x_, it will be _xp_ and _xn_.

##### function findSolution(variableName: string, solution: number[], vars: string[]): number

Obtain a solution that corresponds to _variableName_. _Solution_ and _vars_ are those given by simplex().
If variable is replaced to positive and negative parts (e.g., _xp_ and _xn_ such that _x = xp - xn_),
findSolution() will find both parts and returns the final solution (in above example, _x_).
If _variableName_ is not in _vars_, it returns NaN.

##### function simplexIsOK(): boolean

Returns true when build condition meets. Else, return false;

## Install

```Shell
> npm i linear-program-solver
```

### Trouble shooting

#### Warning _'Compiler supporting C++-17 or newer required'_

You may see this message during installation, if your default C++ compiler is so. You can specify other compiler by setting CXX environment parameter.

```Shell
> export CXX=/your/new/c++/Compiler
```

#### Solution seems wrong.

Three possible reasons.

1. When the build conditions do not meet, it returns 'inviavel' regardless the given problem.
1. The given problem is grammatically wrong.
1. Bugs of the solver or wrapper.

During installation of this module, it compiles C++ code on your computer. Compiling this module requires N-API (node API) version 6 or greater, that comes with BigInt support. Node 10.20.0 has it. Node 11.15.0 seems not. See [the version matrix](https://nodejs.org/api/n-api.html#n_api_n_api_version_matrix).

In some cases, node-gyp you are running is old. Some Linux has a pretty old node-gyp that came with apt install. You can install the latest node-gyp by

```Shell
> npm i -g node-gyp
```

To check the grammar of the problem, you may try [Simplex-web](https://jeronimonunes.github.io/simplex-web/).

#### Failed to install to Windows

Sorry, install scripts are written for Unix and I don' have a Windows PC. But the main code would and should work on Windows. If you can volunteer a script for Windows, very welcome.

If you already have a C++ compiler, python, node-gyp and installed every necessary module, you can manually build it from command console like this way (sorry not tested),

```Shell
> cd c:\users\your\prefered\folder
> git clone https://github.com/kchinzei/linear-program-solver.git
> cd linear-program-solver
> node-gyp rebuild
> npm run build
> cd c:\users\your\root
> npm i c:\users\your\prefered\folder\linear-program-solver
```

## Known issues

The tableau data generated by [linear-program-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/linear-program-parser) is represented by `Fraction` (but not that of fraction.js).
To translate javascript `Fraction` to C++ class, it uses `BigInt` to `long` coercion, that can be a lossy conversion.
